This is Minimaxing, a free HTML5 + CSS3 by nodethirtythree for FCT (freecsstemplates.org). It's lightweight
and fully responsive with support for wide, standard, and mobile displays.

I created this design primarily as a test of 5grid, a new responsive, grid-based, HTML5+CSS3 design framework
I'm working on. It's in beta right now, but if you're interested in trying it out for yourself, go here to
download it:

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)

PS: To see what Minimaxing looks like in 1000px and mobile, just shrink your browser window -- you'll see
the alternate styles kick in automatically.
